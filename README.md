# Retirement_System_Analysis
The collection includes narratives about financial ebbs and flows, which are lit by measures like market assets, contributions, and expenses. Our journey begins with a deep dive into contributions—the lifeblood of retirement systems—made by both employees and employers. We hope to learn about the consequences for retirement security by investigating funding patterns. Furthermore, investment-related measures such as fair value movements and net income shed light on retirement plans' financial success, which is critical to their long-term viability. However, despite the abundance of data, gaps and unsolved questions arise. Missing information, such as comprehensive member demographics and investment strategy, prompts further investigation. Such data could provide insights into differences in retirement outcomes as well as the efficacy of various investment options. A more in-depth assessment of plan characteristics may also reveal details that influence member preferences and plan effectiveness. As we examine this dataset, our goals go beyond analysis; we want to find trends and patterns that can help us understand retirement planning and lead to actionable findings. Our journey is one of discovery, enlightenment, and empowerment, with the ultimate goal of helping to improve society’s well-being and individual success in retirement. 



The initial stage in this analytical journey was to meticulously prepare the data to verify the dataset's integrity and trustworthiness. This phase included a thorough check for zeros, null values, error values, severe outliers, duplicates, and other inconsistencies. Zeros, particularly in columns such as contributions, were examined to see if they represented missing or incorrect data. Depending on the data context, imputation approaches such as mean, median, or mode were used to address null values. Error values, such as negative numbers in fields supposed to contain only positive values, were discovered and fixed.Detecting extreme outliers required statistical approaches, such as z-scores, to quantify their impact on the data. The significance of these outliers determined whether they were removed or transformed. Duplicate records were detected and eliminated to ensure data accuracy. Ensuring uniformity in data formatting and resolving conflicts was critical in building the groundwork for relevant analyses.
